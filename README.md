## Comments

I'm not sure my EditorConfig plugin is working correctly. I tried, per the README file's suggestion, to run the command **EditorConfig: Show State** but it said the command was not found. Other than that, I think I'm getting the hang of the staging/committing cycle.

My repository is posted [here] (https://github.com/kescobar10/hw_git_escobar_kenia).
