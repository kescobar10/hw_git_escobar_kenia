        <h1>Penguins, again</h1>
            <p>Last semester, my final project for Advanced Web 1 was about penguins, so I'm keeping the tradition alive. Here is some dummy text so this paragraph doesn't look so empty.

        <h2>Penguins of the animal kind</h2>
            <p>My first page was about animal penguins. There are 17 species of penguins (the animal kind), and those are found exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere. Because they aren't used to danger from animals on solid ground, wild penguins exhibit no particular fear of human tourists. In the 16th century, the word penguin actually referred to great auks (scientific name: Pinguinus impennis), a now-extinct species that inhabited the seas around eastern Canada. When explorers traveled to the Southern Hemisphere, they saw black and white birds that resembled auks, and called them penguins..</p>
        <h2>Penguins of the hockey kind</h2>
            <p>My second type of penguins featured were the Pittsburgh Penguins. The Pittsburgh Penguins are penguins of the hockey variety. Somehow, they have won the Stanley Cup five times – in 1991, 1992, 2009, 2016, and in 2017. Good for them. In the 2017 Conference Finals, the Penguins won against the Ottawa Senators in seven games, and moved on the Stanley Cup Finals where they faced the Nashville Predators. The Penguins won. By defending their title, the Penguins became the first team since the 1997–98 Detroit Red Wings to successfully defend their title, and the first to do so in the salary cap era.</p>
        <h2>Penguins of the book kind</h2>
            <p>My final kind of penguins was books, as in, the books published by the publisher Penguin Books. Penguin Books is a British book publisher. On July 30, 1935, Allen Lane introduced paperback Penguin Books, bridging the gap between expensive hardcover books and cheap newspapers. With that middle option—and with distribution in places other than bookstores—the Penguin line became a staple of booksellers worldwide. Penguin paperbacks were actually inexpensive enough to be sold from a vending machine. Another early part of Lane's vision was simple color coding for Penguin titles. Orange denoted fiction, dark blue for biography, and green for crime. Just ten months after their launch, more than a million Penguins books had been printed..</p>
